## Installation

You will need Fabric Loader 0.11.x or newer installed in your game in order to load this mod. If you haven't installed Fabric mods before, you can find a variety of community guides for doing so [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

This mod is still a work in progress 
Mod is being developed under 1.17.x, will update to ~~1.18.x~~ and a 1.16 backport will start once it's got enough. 
UPDATE: The mod's been updated to 1.18, development will still be happening under 1.17 but the port was really simple to do. 


I've made a [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbMDUPB), join to get help or support, I'll also be providing compiled builds for testing in it.
